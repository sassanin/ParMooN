// base function values
// vector function, orthonormal to edges, 
// functions 1,2,3, and 4 are orthogonal to edge 1
// functions 5,6,7, and 8 are orthogonal to edge 2
// functions 9,10,11, and 12 are orthogonal to edge 3
// functions 13,14,15, and 16 are orthogonal to edge 4
// functions 17-22 correspond to inner degrees of freedom

// NOTE: If you want to use other evaluation points for degress of freedom on
// the edges of a cell, you also have to change basis functions in
// NF_N_Q_BDM3_2D.h


// coefficient matrix for different choices of the degrees of freedom
// There seems to be no difference in using integral or point evaluation for 
// inner dofs. 

// The dofs on the edges determine the boundary conditions as well. Using 
// Tschebyscheff-points might improve the boundary approximation.
