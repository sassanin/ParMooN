This directory contains performance example programs that call the ACML. Use
the GNUmakefile to compile, run, and plot the results of the programs:

 % make

You may need to edit the GNUmakefile to point at the correct location of your 
installed copy of the ACML, or to change compilers and flags. 
To plot timing graphs of all the results using gnuplot, without regenerating
them, type 

 % make plots 

To plot individual results for the data file time_<name>.res, run 

 % ./plot_one.sh <name>

If you do not have gnuplot, please install it. The utility's homepage is
www.gnuplot.info - note that gnuplot version 4.0 or later is required.

If you are on an SMP (multiprocessor) machine and have installed an OpenMP
version of the ACML, then a command such as

 % make OMP_NUM_THREADS=5

will run the timing programs on P processors, where P = 1, 2, 4, 5; i.e.,
P equals an integer power of 2 and also equals OMP_NUM_THREADS if this value 
is not a power of 2. The results for a particular routine are concatenated into 
one file. gnuplot then shows on one graph for each routine the results of 
varying the number of processors for that routine. As before, these graphs can 
be viewed without regenerating the results by typing

 % make plots
